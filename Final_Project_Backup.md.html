<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">As a backup final project idea, I would like to take inspiration from the Data Analytics Mentorship Program and do something in the sports sector as that is what my mentor does. I would like to create a basketball shot location analysis.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=5 data-line-end=6 ><a id="Tractable_Data_5"></a>Tractable Data</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">The idea behind this project is I gather my own data for each player on a given basketball team (the team is still TBD) and record their shot location as well as data such as if they were defended, fouled, shotclock, and gametime remaining.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=8 data-line-end=9 ><a id="Data_Retrieval_8"></a>Data Retrieval</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">Unfortunately the only way to retrieve this data with the resources I have at hand is manually recording. My plan is to create a dashboard via Streamlit where you can select a player then input on an overlay of a basketball court the shot location and fill in boxes for the data mentioned above. So while the data is manually recorded, tools will be made for quicker and more user friendly recording.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=11 data-line-end=12 ><a id="Model_11"></a>Model</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">The idea behind getting the shot locations is we can look at where players make and miss the most shots and use that to optimize game strategy for maximum point value. For example, if a player shoots at 33% from the top of the 3pt line, the expected point value is 1 (.33 * 3) meanwhile if they shoot at 80% from right next to the basket, the expected point value is 1.6. Information like this could be crucial to optimizing game strategy.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=14 data-line-end=15 ><a id="Implications_for_Stakeholders_14"></a>Implications for Stakeholders</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16">The main groups that would obviously be impacted by this are the coaches and the players. With this information, coaches are better able to create plays that play to players strengths and know what risks to take and when. As for players, it’s important for players to know their own strength on the court and what their best opportunities are.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=17 data-line-end=18 ><a id="Ethical_and_Societal_Implications_17"></a>Ethical and Societal Implications</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="19">It is of course important to note that there are potentially teams who already have a system like this in effect so it’s important to not infringe on any copyright that another team may have. That being said, the positive societal implications this project as a whole can show how data can improve performance evaluation in the world of sports in a major way.</p>
