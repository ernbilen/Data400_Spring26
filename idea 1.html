<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">30-second-hook rule definition: “the critical opening segment of a presentation, video, or sales pitch designed to instantly capture audience attention, establish relevance, and encourage continued engagement”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8">This rule is a common industry standard metric in digital business. For example, when we listening to a song in spotify, if we did not skip to another in the first 30 seconds, the song is counted as “played” in the statistics, and the artist will earn. if we skipped in the fist 30 seconds, the music is considered “not been played” and the artist get nothing.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">This rule basically applies to almost every streaming services like youtube, tiktok,instagram reels etc,etc.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">Data from main stream service, for example,<strong>Spotify Web API</strong> for detailed audio features and the <strong>YouTube Data API</strong> for engagement metrics like views and likes, Or TikTok-specific trends, I will utilize datasets that aggregate song “virality” metrics, such as post counts and views.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="20">The project will evaluate how song structures (e.g., intro length, time-to-hook) vary between different streaming services and time period. I’m not exactly sure what model/tool to use specifically, but the following goal will definitely included:<br>
use regression to find the “important feature”<br>
prediction model that will offer to make prediction of a content according to their features.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="24">Streaming service company(apparently)<br>
label company: Since the 30 second hook rule is so crutial for the business and income, they would need the information to make decision, like what kind of artist they want to sign etc<br>
artist, influencer, and Content creator: this may help them gain more popularity by shaping their style, content.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=24 data-line-end=25 ><a id="Ethical_Legal_Societal_Implications_24"></a><strong>Ethical, Legal, Societal Implications</strong></h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="26" data-line-end="27">I don’t think this will create any harm on the society, as long as the data is accessed legally and ethically.</p>
