# Theoretical Basis

Minority stress theory: the theory that **exposure to discrimination** physically degrades the body and produces **poorer health outcomes** for those affected.

--

LGBTQ+ Americans generally experience **worse physical and mental health** than cisgender, heterosexual Americans, both because of discrimination-induced health problems and barriers to healthcare access.

--

LGBTQ+ Americans are "at greater risk of dying by suicide, of cardiovascular disease, and of a cascading list of other health problems" (Harvard). The **health factors** in this investigation are thus:

--

- Physical health
- Depression and mental health
- Health risk factors like smoking or binge drinking
---
# Data Sources

The **ACLU**'s dataset "**Mapping Attacks on LGBTQ Rights in U.S. State Legislatures**" tracks state-level anti-LGBTQ+ legislation from 2018 on.

--

The **CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System** (BRFSS) reports demographic, physical health, mental health, and health risk behavior data from hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens each year, from 1991 through 2024. It tracks respondents' sexual orientation, so **this investigation considers only LGBTQ+ BRFSS respondents**. 

--

Considering data from **2020 to 2024** captures the timeframe of the recent increase in anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, encapsulating attacks such as:

--

- Healthcare restrictions
- Religious exemptions
- School curriculum censorship
- Excluding transgender youth from sports
- Anti-trans "bathroom bans"

## Increase in Anti-LGBTQ+ Legislation

## Health Measures by Year and State
.pull-left[&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="Mini Project Images/Fair-Poor Health Year-State.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt; 
&lt;img src="Mini Project Images/Depression Year-State.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;]

.pull-right[BRFSS Health Question: "Would you say that in general your health is: Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, or Poor? (BRFSS)"

Both the proportion of BRFSS respondents who report **fair or poor health** and the proportion who had a **depressive disorder** at any time in their lives **seem to increase with the number of anti-LGBTQ+ bills introduced** in a state in that year.

However, because many states introduced 0 or otherwise few anti-LGBTQ+ bills in a given year, **this correlation is not strong**.]

class: inverse

## Health Measures by Year and State
.pull-left[BRFSS respondents' risk behaviors of **smoking and binge drinking** appear to have **little to no relationship** with the number of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation introduced in their state in a given year.

Such **risk behaviors could be used to cope with stress**. However, the national average of LGBTQ+ BRFSS respondents who smoke **decreased from 18.7% to 12.6%** from 2020 to 2024, suggesting that the overall level of LGBTQ+ smokers in the U.S. is decreasing and that **this is not a coping mechanism associated with the rise in anti-LGBTQ+ legislation**.]

&lt;img src="Mini Project Images/Smoker Year-State.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;

## Health Measures vs. Anti-LGBTQ+ Legislation

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="Mini Project Images/Fair-Poor Health by Year.png" style="width: 45%;" /&gt; &lt;img src="Mini Project Images/Depression by Year.png" style="width: 45%;" /&gt; 
&lt;/center&gt;

At the national level, both the proportion of BRFSS respondents who reported **fair or poor health** and the proportion of respondents who had a **depressive disorder** anytime in their life **increased as the number of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation increased**.

Of course, this is correlational, not causal. These factors are tied to the rising political turmoil in the United States following 2020.

## State Case Study: Missouri

.pull-left[&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src="Mini Project Images/Missouri.png" style="width: 100%;" /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;]

.pull-right[- Missouri has the highest number of Anti-LGBTQ+ bills introduced from 2020-2024 (**119 bills**) but only passed 2.

- The proportion of respondents who reported **fair or poor health** rose noticeably from 2023 to 2024, perhaps a result of the dramatic increase in anti-LGBTQ+ legislation the previous year. 

- **This could show the impact of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation on LGBTQ+ people's health regardless of whether the bills pass**.]

## Stakeholders &amp; Societal/Ethical Implications

Understanding the potential physical and mental health effects of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation allows:

- **LGBTQ+ Americans and their families** to make informed decisions to proactively protect their physical and mental health.

--

- **Educators** to take steps to **protect the wellbeing of their LGBTQ+ students** (ex: creating affirming classrooms, combatting forced outing in schools). 

--

- **Public health officials** and **healthcare providers** to provide accurate recommendations for LGBTQ+ patients in states with high levels of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation (ex: highlighting local affirming health resources and proactive health-protecting measures). 

--

- **Activist organizations** to design **resources to support LGBTQ+ health** in the most-affected states (ex: LGBTQ+ health education, lists of affirming medical providers).

---
class: inverse

## Stakeholders &amp; Societal/Ethical Implications

Understanding the potential physical and mental health effects of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation allows:

- **Legislators** to understand the material harms created by anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and instead introduce and **approve legislation to protect LGBTQ+ rights and health**. 

--

- **All American citizens** to comprehend the importance of - and campaign for - **pro-LGBTQ+ rights legislation**. 

--

****

Generally, this correlation between anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and poor physical and mental health for LGBTQ+ Americans expands our understanding of **anti-LGBTQ+ legislation** as **unethical** and **harmful to public health and to American democratic ideals**.

---

# Limitations

This investigation has several limitations due to the availability of the selected data, including:

- The BRFSS only tracks respondents' sexual orientation, not trans- or cisgender identity, so **the health markers considered in this investigation are only those of sexual minority respondents**. This is a significant limitation because a large proportion of the anti-LGBTQ+ bills are anti-trans bills, and their effect on trans Americans' health is critical to investigate. 

--

- **The BRFSS was not conducted in all states**, and it is often states with high numbers of anti-LGBTQ+ bills introduced which did not conduct the survey consistently if at all (ex: Oklahoma, Tennessee, and South Carolina - ranked 2nd, 3rd, and 5th in number of anti-LGBTQ+ bills, respectively). So, **it is difficult to determine how the health of LGBTQ+ citizens from these states has been affected**.

---

# Potential for Further Investigation

This investigation can be expanded by:

- Incorporating statistics from the **Trevor Project** on LGBTQ+ youth's (**including trans and nonbinary youth**) mental health, exposure to physical violence, exposure to discrimination, access to mental health care, and changes in wellbeing due to anti-LGBTQ+ politics. This could **expand the project to include sexual minority children and trans and nonbinary children** since the BRFSS only reports data for adults. 

--

- **Developing a model to predict LGBTQ+ health measures** in a state given the legislative and demographic reality (ex: percentage uninsured) of the previous year, which **acknowledges a time delay** between the introduction of legislation and its material effects.
