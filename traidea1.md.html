<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">Media coverage plays a central role in shaping public awareness and collective consciousness about global events. In the United States, newspaper headlines particularly front-page stories have long served as a focal point for daily conversations about international affairs. This project examines how global attention has shifted over time by analyzing front-page headlines published by The New York Times between 1900 and 2025.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">Using the New York Times digital archive, this study identifies which countries most frequently appeared in prominent news coverage during different historical periods. By tracking the rise and decline of country mentions across more than a century, this research aims to reveal how wars, political conflicts, economic power shifts, and global crises influence which parts of the world occupy U.S. media attention at any given time.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8">Based on historical context, certain periods are expected to show concentrated coverage of specific regions or countries. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">1967–1975: Heavy emphasis on Vietnam due to the Vietnam War, alongside coverage of the Yom Kippur War and broader Cold War dynamics.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">1940–1945: Predominant focus on European and Axis powers during World War II.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="12">2001–2011: Increased coverage of Afghanistan and Iraq following the September 11 attacks and subsequent wars.<br>
These patterns are expected to demonstrate how geopolitical events shape media focus over time.</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="19">This project uses web scraping and API-based data collection to retrieve articles published between 1900 and 2025. The dataset is filtered to include only:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="20">Articles classified as “news” or “article”</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="20" data-line-end="21">Stories that appeared on the front page or section front</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="22">Country mentions are identified through keyword matching that includes: official country names, common acronyms, major cities</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start=22 data-line-end=23 ><a id="Ethical_Considerations_22"></a>Ethical Considerations</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="23" data-line-end="24">While this research relies on publicly available archival data, several ethical considerations remain important:</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26">Front-page coverage reflects editorial bias and institutional priorities</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="26" data-line-end="27">Frequency of mention does not equal importance or positive representation</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="28">Some regions may be underrepresented due to geopolitical power imbalances</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="28" data-line-end="29">Historical headlines may contain outdated or biased language and will be interpreted in historical context</li>
</ol>
