<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4"><strong>Research Question:</strong> Do factors, such as demographics and political climate, impact the rate of antisemitism is the United States?</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">For centuries, the Jewish people have faced descrimination and violence. Over the past few years, the frequency of hate crimes against Jews has been rapidly increasing. As a Jewish American, watching the rise of antisemitism has been heartbreaking and terrifying. I have come to wonder what factors have affected this rate and how addressing such factors could potentially reduce the frequency of antisemitic acts. Hate crimes, including antisemitic acts, have been tracked more consistently in recent years which will be useful for gaining access to the data I will need.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8">Organizations such as the <a href="https://www.adl.org">Anti-Defamation League</a> and <a href="https://standwithus.com">Stand With Us</a> track large amounts of data related to hate crime incidents and where and when they occurred. I am currently looking into how to best retrieve data from these sites. In combination with <a href="https://data.census.gov">U.S. census data</a> which has many publically available tables, I hope to compare the rates of antisemitic acts with various factors (e.g., location, voting trends, diversity) to gain a better sense of what is contributing to the rising number of events.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">For my project, I will use regression models. This will allow me to understand which factors are affecting my depedent variable, the rate of antisemetic acts. Ridge regression may be very useful, however I will need to see how coorelated my data is and how each types of model reacts to it.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12">Analyzing what is driving the increase in antisemitic hate crimes in the U.S. is a task that is not only useful for stakeholders at organizations, such as the ADL to be able to more accurately target causes, but also to government officials, such as Zohran Mamdani, the mayor of New York City, where anti-jewish acts are the most prominent in America. Being able to pinpoint key factors could greately improve the effectiveness of these stakeholders’ efforts to combat this hatred and protect the Jews of America.</p>
