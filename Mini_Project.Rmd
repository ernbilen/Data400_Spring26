## Research Question

How do macroeconomic conditions influence the sales levels and product mix of life insurance and annuities?

More specifically:

- Do interest rates, labor markets, and volatility
  systematically affect demand?
- Are some product types more macro-sensitive than others?
- Can macro indicators help explain sales increases or declines?
---
class: incremental

## Why This Matters

Insurance demand is not static.

Economic conditions influence:

- Household income stability
- Risk tolerance
- Savings behavior
- Preference for guarantees

Understanding these relationships improves
forecasting, planning, and strategic decision-making.

## Types of Life Insurance?

Life insurance provides a payment to beneficiaries upon death. Two primary categories:

- **Term Life**
  - Coverage for a fixed period
  - Lower cost
  - Pure protection

- **Permanent Life**
  - Lifetime coverage
  - Includes a savings component
  - Higher premiums
  - More sensitive to financial market conditions

class: incremental

## What Are Annuities?

An annuity is a financial product designed to convert savings into income, often for retirement.

Key types:

- **Fixed / Structured Annuities**
  - Provide guaranteed returns or income
  - More attractive when interest rates are high

- **SPDA (Single Premium Deferred Annuity)**
  - One large upfront payment
  - Growth accumulates until future payout
  - Highly sensitive to interest rate environments
---
class: incremental

## Project Scope

- Channel-level aggregate production
- Monthly sales data
- Focus on:
  - Total Life WNAP
  - Term share of Life production
- Directional relationships (not individual organizational performance)

Goal:
Identify macro-linked demand patterns.

class: incremental

## Data Overview

### 1. Sales Outcomes (Monthly)
- Life WNAP  
- Term WNAP  
- Total annuity premium  
- SPDA premium  
- Term share of Life WNAP

### 2. Macro & Market Indicators (Monthly)
- Unemployment rate  
- 2-Year Treasury yield  
- 12-month rate impulse  
- Yield curve slope (10Y–2Y)  
- VIX (volatility)  
- Inflation measures (CPI)
---
class: incremental

## Why This Problem Is Tractable

- Public macro data (FRED) are high-frequency and reliable
- Sales data are consistently measured monthly
- Time alignment enables structured regression analysis
- Transformations ensure statistical stability

Scope is intentionally limited to:
macro conditions → aggregate demand response
---
class: incremental

**Model Windows**
- Year-over-year variables require 12-month lag
- Annuity & SPDA models begin: mid-2011
- Life & Term-share models: 2015–2025
- Windows selected based on:
  - Data consistency
  - Structural comparability

## How Premiums Are Measured

For annuities and large premium products:

- We use year-over-year percentage change
- Instead of raw dollar amounts

Why?

- Controls for extreme spikes
- Makes growth rates easier to compare
- Common practice in economic research
---
class: incremental

## Term Share Adjustment

Term share is a percentage (between 0% and 100%).

Because percentages are naturally bounded,
we apply a standard statistical adjustment
to make the regression behave properly.

Purpose: Rescaling the percentage so it can be modeled accurately.

## Life Sales Adjustment

Total Life production is highly skewed
(a few large months can dominate).

We apply a log transformation to:

- Reduce distortion from large spikes
- Improve stability
- Allow interpretation in approximate % terms

---
class: incremental

## Regression Framework

We use a standard statistical method:
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).

The model controls for:

- Seasonality (some months are always stronger)
- Long-term growth trend

Macroeconomic variables are added
to see whether they move together with sales.

## The Protection Gap in the U.S.

Life insurance and annuities provide financial protection and continuity for families.

Yet:

- Tens of millions of Americans have no life insurance.
- Many more are underinsured relative to their needs.
- A large share of households would face hardship
  within months of losing a primary income earner.

Protection gaps are not evenly distributed —
they are larger among lower- and middle-income households.

## Why Macroeconomics Matters for Coverage

Economic stress affects:

- Employment stability
- Household income
- Risk tolerance
- Ability to afford premiums

Historically:
- Coverage ownership can decline during recessions.
- Demand shifts during high-volatility periods.
- Rising rates change the attractiveness of certain products.

Macro conditions influence who stays protected —
and who drops coverage.
---
class: incremental

## Why This Study Is Important

Understanding macro sensitivity allows the channel I am on to:

- Anticipate when protection levels may fall
- Plan distribution and outreach more effectively
- Set responsible growth expectations
- Support households through economic cycles

This is not only a strategic question —
it is a financial stability question.

Sustainable growth and sustained protection
should move together.
