# Second Idea
### Delaney Reimer

My second idea is to track the subscription numbers over time of the different major streaming services (Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Paramount+, and Peacock). To see what factors influence subscription numbers, I will be looking at:
- Makeup (% original programming)
- Subscription Prices
- Addition of Ads/Higher-Priced Ad-Free Tiers

The data for what percentage of total content is original programming created by and for the streaming service would likely be available on the individual websites for each streaming service. Datasets containing information on numbers of subscribers and subscription prices are likely to be the most easily available, and my trouble will be in finding specific datasets containing information about ads (whether in certain tiers or across all subscribers) and I may have to add that in myself, though it's unlikely to have changed many times, so that won't be too difficult. 

This would use an inferential model to see how prices, ads, and original programming are correlated to how many subscribers streaming services have.

My project would be important to both consumers--to have a model showing them how much streaming services cost and how that has changed, as well as what they can expect from a given streaming service--and to those working for the streaming services themselves, as they would gain more information on how customers react to changes in the makeup or pricing of streaming services and how best to draw them in without losing their customer base.

There would be no ethical issues that I can see in terms of collecting the data, as this is all publically available information provided by streaming services to the public.
