## Project Summary and Data Tractability

This project aims to examine the potential reasons for cancellation of various Netflix original shows after only 1 season. The different aspects I plan to look at include:

- **Viewership Stats** - total hours watched and total watches of the show
- **Number of Weeks in the Top 10** (if any)
- **Audience Content Rating** - e.g., TV-PG, TV-MA, etc.
- **Genre(s)/Categorization**

The first 2 points both relate to the popularity of the series on the platform, both individually (viewership) and comparatively (presence among top 10 most popular shows at a time). 

The third and fourth points both relate to accessibility and breadth of audience: TV-PG shows could be seen by children and adults alike vs. TV-MA shows, and Action & Adventure shows might be more palatable to a wider audience than, say, Crime shows.

## Data Retrieval

My data was accumulated from multiple different datasets. I pulled Audience Content Rating from What's On Netflix.

---
Then I pulled genre data from 2 different Kaggle datasets.
![Genres](/Users/delaneyr/miniproject_files/images/genre.png)
---
I downloaded top 10 data from Tudum.

---
Data about viewership stats pulled from the Netflix Engagement Reports was downloaded off of What's On Netflix.
![Views](/Users/delaneyr/miniproject_files/images/views.png)
---
And finally, data about which shows were cancelled vs. ongoing was pulled from 2 different Wikipedia pages.

After several merges, I finally had a dataframe containing all of the information I wanted to look at.

## Implications for Stakeholders

- **For owners**: Either confirms the choices they made to cancel or renew a show or gets them to look more closely at why they cancelled a series that may have had potential or greater popularity than they thought.

- **For investors**: Greater insight into where Netflix is focused and if the shows that are cancelled are significantly less popular and profitable than those that are not.

- **For subscribers**: Additional knowledge about what shows may be more likely to get renewed and are safe to get invested in.
---
## Ethical/Legal/Societal Implications

- All of this data is publicly available, provided either by Netflix themselves or scraped from Netflix

- Creates greater insight about cancellation process to those that pay for the service

- Furthers research about popularity of certain genres

- Promotes transparency for the viewers about why certain shows are cancelled (since most cancellation announcements do not include the reasoning behind it)
