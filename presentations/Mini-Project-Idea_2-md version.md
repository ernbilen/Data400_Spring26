#### Idea 2:Variation in Nutritional Quality of Public School Lunches across US

##### Research Question:
How does the nutritional quality of public school lunches vary across U.S. school districts, and to what extent do districts differ in their compliance with federal nutrition standards?
##### Abstract
Public school lunch programs in the United States operate under federal nutritional guidelines, yet school districts retain flexibility in menu design and food procurement. This project examines variation in the nutritional quality of school lunches across U.S. school districts, focusing on differences in calorie content, sodium levels, and food group compliance with federal standards. Using nationally collected school meal nutrition data, the study documents the extent of inter-district variation and identifies which nutritional components show the greatest divergence. The analysis provides a descriptive and inferential assessment of how uniformly federal nutrition standards are implemented across districts.
##### Data Sources
1.USDA School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study (SNMCS)
-Nutritional composition of school lunches (calories, sodium, fat, added sugars, food group servings).
-School- or district-level records.
2.National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)
-District identifiers, enrollment size, grade span, and urbanicity.

##### Strategy: Descriptive and inferential
1.Outcome variables:
-Calories per lunch
-Sodium per lunch
-Compliance indicators for USDA nutrition standards
-Servings of fruits, vegetables, whole grains
2.Control variables:
-District size
-Grade levels served (elementary vs secondary)
-Urban, suburban, or rural classification
3.Approach
-Compute summary statistics and distributions of nutritional indicators across districts.
-Compare compliance rates across district types (e.g., size, urbanicity).
-Use regression or grouped comparisons to assess which district characteristics are associated with greater variation in nutritional quality.

##### Stakeholders
-Students and families who rely on school lunches for daily nutrition.
-School food service departments responsible for menu planning and procurement.
-Education and nutrition policymakers overseeing compliance with federal standards.
-Public health researchers studying institutional food environments.

##### Ethical Implications
-Unequal nutritional quality across districts raises equity and justice questions, especially for students who rely on school meals as a primary source of nutrition.
-Variation in compliance may impact childhood health, including risks for obesity, hypertension, or nutrient deficiencies.
-Highlights societal responsibility to ensure that federally mandated nutrition standards achieve uniform protective effects for all children.
-Raises policy questions about resource allocation: districts with limited budgets may struggle to meet standards, creating systemic inequities.
