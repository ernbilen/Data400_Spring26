<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="6">When a College or University wins a National Championship in basketball, football and hockey, how does winning a championship in 3 major sports effect the schools applications? Does winning a national chamionship in a sport cause more applications to the school? Do some sports cause more applications than others?</li>

<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16">Sports Reference: Download the data for each of the three major sports and all of the schools that won national championships over the last 20 years. <a href="https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/postseason/">Sports Reference</a></li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="18">EDFacts Retrieval: Create a custom dataset with the list of schools that won the national championship and their data on enrollement, applications, acceptance rate and test ssores the year after they won. <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/InstitutionByName.aspx?goToReportId=5&amp;sid=5b318ed5-7d5d-400f-84f7-ef9569f45b31&amp;rtid=5">IPEDS</a></li>

<h1 class="code-line" data-line-start=18 data-line-end=19 ><a id="3_Specification_of_the_Model_18"></a>3. Specification of the Model:</h1>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="20" data-line-end="21">I will Be using a Difference in Differences Model that compares schools that have won a national chamionship vs a population of schools that did not win a national chamionship and their incoming sutdent data the following year.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="23">A baseline or other forms of a DiD model is the simplest and best way to estimate whether winning a national championship aka athletic success leads to an increase in incoming students.</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="code-line" data-line-start=23 data-line-end=24 ><a id="4_Implications_for_Stakeholders_23"></a>4. Implications for Stakeholders:</h1>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="24" data-line-end="25">Schools: With the new regulations regarding paying student athletes, schools are stakeholders because winning a national championship in a division 1 sport can lead to nationwide attention and an increase in potential student interest in your school. If your school recieves more applications due to winning a national championship, its given that the schools acceptance rate will go down due to the popularity of athletics, therefore schools recieve a certain level of academic prestige due to an increase in potential student intrest.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26">Students: Potential students have alot of factors to consider when considering a school that usually focuses on academic goals and professional goals after school. But with schools spending more money on student athletes, does athletics play a significant role in students decision making to go to certain schools?</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="26" data-line-end="27">Admissions: In admissions if you are reciving more applications due to athletic success, your job becomes increasingly harder, having to take a more in depth look at what students apply and in the end having to deny more students due to the increase in applications.</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="code-line" data-line-start=27 data-line-end=28 ><a id="5_Ethical_Legal_and_Societal_implications_27"></a>5. Ethical, Legal and Societal implications:</h1>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="28" data-line-end="29">Ethical: Due to the changes in college athletics and paying student athletes, the ethical dilemma that arises is whether or not spending more money on athletics whether through the school budget or through investors to increase your schools popularity and attention and profit is ethical. On the one hand, if you invest alot of money into athletes and you win lots of national championships and your school is thriving because of it is not a bad thing. But what happens when schools invest lots of money into athletics to raise popularity, and you have no success in those sports, that is a major risk many schools in the U.S take that could cost them emmensely.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="29" data-line-end="30">Legal: Is is legal in the world of college sports if one school has the ability to spend millions more money on their athletes compared to other schools? This could cause an imbalance of competition within the coliegate level of sports similar to the MLB in the sense that Teams with more money are able to sign the best players simply because they are able to pay more money than other teams.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="30" data-line-end="31">Societal: As a society we are drawn to success, whether that is academic, professional or athletic success. With the rise in paying student athletes, schools are basically signing big name highschool athletes in order to recruit more students to their school. Does athletic success at a school have a role in potential student enrollment, if so what is stopping schools from spending as much money as possible in sports in order to raise their popularity? Essentially creating a David vs goliath story of schools who spend money on athletics vs schools who do not.</li>
