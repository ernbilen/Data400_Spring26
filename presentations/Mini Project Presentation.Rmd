# Why Fourth Down Decisions Matter

- NFL games occur in high stakes, high visibility environments
  - Games regularly attract 15-20 million viewers, with some games reaching much higher
  
- Fourth-down choices can swing win probability and expected points.

- Teams face a tradeoff between risk (turnover on downs) and reward (sustaining drives / scoring).

- This project uses play-by-play data to quantify what drives “go for it” decisions.

---
# Data

- Source: nflverse/nflfastR play by play (public dataset located on GitHub)

  - Insalled as nflreadpy package in python
  
- Unit of observation: One NFL Play

- Sample: 25,445 4th down plays from 2020-2025, making it computationally feasible for modeling and EDA

- Key Variables: ydstogo, yardline_100, score_differential, minutes_remaining, wp, play_type which are all cleaned and analytically usable

---
# Data Retrieval and Feature Engineering

- Dowload nflverse Play-by-Play data from the nflreadpy package

    → Filter (down == 4)  

    → Feature Engineering (`go_for_it`, minutes_remaining)

    → Logistic Regression Dataset cleaning

- Decision Variable:
  - go_for_it = 1 if play_type is run or pass
  
  - go_for_it = 0 if play_type is punt or field goal

# EDA 1: Macro Trends
![Graph of 4th down aggressiveness over time](Overtimeaggressiveness.png)
- We see go-for-it rate increasing over time
- Consistent with analytic driven decision making being widely adopted across the league
- Teams appear more willing to accept the risk of going for it for the greater gain in points

- We see that teams are more likely to go for it when losing by more points, and also more likely when they are up big.

- We also see teams are more likely to go for it with less yards to go.

- These graphs confirm our dataset is making sense and agreeing with largely known NFL strategy

# Preliminary Logistic Model

**Objective:**  
- Estimate the probability that a team goes for it on fourth down given the game situation.

**Model Type:**  
- Logistic regression (binary decision: go for it vs kick)

**Model Fit:**  
- Observations: 25,455 fourth-down plays  
- Pseudo R² ≈ 0.283 (strong for behavioral decision data)  
- Model is statistically significant (p < 0.001)

**Key Findings:**  
- Yards to go has a strong negative effect on aggressiveness  
- Teams are more aggressive in favorable field position (closer to the end zone)  
- Higher win probability is associated with more conservative decision-making

---
# Team Agressiveness
- Predict expected behavior based on the model, without coach, team or players.
- Take the actual decision, subtract from the prediction value and get a residual, then aggregate by team.

# Implications for Stakeholders

**Coaches & Front Offices**
- Provides an evidence-based benchmark for fourth-down decision-making  
- Identifies whether a team(or coach) is overly conservative or aggressive relative to situational expectations  

**Analysts & Broadcasters**
- Moves discussion beyond hindsight bias (“they should have gone for it”)  
- Enables more rigorous discussion of coaching decisions using data rather than narrative

**Fans & Media**
- Encourages data-driven interpretation of coaching decisions  
- Fourth down aggressiveness directly impacts win probability and game outcomes

---
# Ethical, Legal, & Societal Implications

**Model Limitations & Misinterpretation**
- Coaching decisions involve context not captured in the data (injuries, weather, player matchups)
- Over-reliance on models could oversimplify complex strategic decisions 

**Responsible Use of Analytics**
- Results should be used as decision support, not as definitive judgments of coaching quality
- Labeling teams as “bad” or “irrational” based solely on model outputs can be misleading  

**Broader Societal Context**
- Increased use of sports analytics reflects a larger shift in society to data
- Findings may influence media narratives, fan perception, and potentially sports betting markets  

**Data Ethics**
- Uses publicly available nflverse data with no personal or private player information

# Adding to Existing Work

- Existing NFL analytics focus more on the optimal decision
  - My model does not incorporate Next Gen Stats (player positioning, injuries, separation, acceleration, etc)

- This work focuses on behavior in relation to the mean, looking at what teams actually decide to do

- This work complements advanced analytics to provide a behavioral benchmark for analyzing team and coach aggressiveness and decision making. It can also be extended to player comparisons in the future.
