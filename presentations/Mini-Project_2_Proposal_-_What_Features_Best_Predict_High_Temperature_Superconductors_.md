# Mini-Project 2 Proposal - What Features Best Predict High Temperature Superconductors?
- 

## Tractable & Retriveable data
The Dataset is taken originally from The National Institute for Materials Science in Japan however it has been cleaned and processed even further and published on Kaggle making the data easily accessible and ready to use. 

## Model
We will use a XGBoost decision-tree ensemble to parse which features are most important in predicting high temperature superconductors.

## Implications for stakeholders and Societal Implications
Finding high Tc superconductors is the holy grail of condensed matter physics. Such a technology could revolutionize our world by making power grids 30% more efficient to allowing for levitating trains and reducing waste heat during computing. However despite materials being found on the verge of what would be considered room temperature for humans, for the last 100 years a truly room temperature superconductor has remained elusive. When scientists do manage to find one in the lab it will rapidly be deeply integrated into some of our most productive high value industries as a technological neccessity to reman competitive.

Room temperature superconductors will benefit society by reducing the amount of energy humans consume by up to one third! They will also allow for faster devices, cheaper electronics, and much longer battery life allowing for vast industry and commerical use.
