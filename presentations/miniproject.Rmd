# Introduction

### Research Focus

**Question:**  
Do NFL teams with higher Polymarket trading volume exhibit higher win percentages?

### Motivation

- Prediction markets reflect crowd beliefs  
- Trading volume may proxy:
  - Attention  
  - Popularity  
  - Information flow  
- Does market interest relate to actual team performance?

# NFL Team Performance

# Exploratory Data Analysis

### Summary Statistics

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(combined_nfl[, c("Volume_USD","Win_Pct")])
```

---

# Distribution of Trading Volume

```{r, echo=FALSE}
hist(combined_nfl$Volume_USD,
     col = "#1f3a66",
     main = "Distribution of Polymarket Trading Volume",
     xlab = "Volume (USD)")

# Distribution of Win Percentage

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

---

# Correlation

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cor(combined_nfl$Volume_USD,
    combined_nfl$Win_Pct)
```

Interpretation:
- Measures linear association
- Range: -1 to 1

---
# Correlation Heatmap

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
# Select numeric variables
numeric_data <- combined_nfl[, c("Volume_USD", "Games_Won", 
                                 "Games_Played", "Win_Pct")]

# Compute correlation matrix
corr_matrix <- cor(numeric_data)

# Create heatmap
heatmap(corr_matrix,
        col = colorRampPalette(c("#1f3a66", "white", "lightblue"))(20),
        scale = "none",
        margins = c(8,8),
        main = "Correlation Heatmap")
```
---

# Scatterplot: Volume vs Win %

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(combined_nfl$Volume_USD,
     combined_nfl$Win_Pct,
     pch = 19,
     col = "#1f3a66",
     xlab = "Trading Volume (USD)",
     ylab = "Win Percentage")

abline(lm(Win_Pct ~ Volume_USD,
          data = combined_nfl),
       col = "lightblue",
       lwd = 2)
```

---

# Regression Model

```{r, echo=FALSE}
model <- lm(Win_Pct ~ Volume_USD,
            data = combined_nfl)

summary(model)
```

# Key Findings

- Weak / moderate / strong correlation?  
- Does higher trading volume predict higher win %?  
- Is the relationship statistically significant?

---
## Implications
#### Societal

- Prediction markets may influence fan perception and media narratives  
- High trading volume could reflect popularity rather than true team strength  
- Public markets may amplify hype cycles around certain teams  

--

#### Ethical Implications
- Access inequality: participation requires crypto & technical literacy  
- Market participation may not represent the broader population  
- Risk of misinterpreting market volume as “true probability”  
- Potential for herd behavior and overreaction  

--

#### Legal Implications

- Sports-related prediction markets operate under CFTC oversight  
- Regulatory status of sports betting varies by state  
- Questions remain about:
  - Market manipulation  
  - Insider information  
  - Jurisdictional legality  

--

## Research Limitations

- Small sample size (32 teams)  
- Single-season snapshot  
- Volume may proxy attention, not information  
- Correlation does not imply causation  

---
# Limitations

- Only 32 teams (small sample size)  
- Single season snapshot  
- Volume may reflect popularity, not information  
- Polymarket sports legality varies by jurisdiction  
- Market participation may not represent entire betting population  

---

# Conclusion

- Liquidity may capture attention effects  
- Relationship appears (strong / weak / insignificant)  
- Future work:
  - Add multiple seasons  
  - Include implied probabilities  
  - Control for market size or fan base
