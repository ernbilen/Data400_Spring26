<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">When lifting, people will sometimes try to push or squat double to triple their bodyweight . Due to the physicality of the lifting, it is possible for people to get seriously injured when trying to perform these heavy lifts. This project aims to develop a data driven approach to estimating one-rep max (1RM) performances using submaximal training data.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">This project is subjective because different people use different weights. Some may be heavier and some may be lighter. I use a kaggle dataset (listed below) that has 3 years worth of recorded exercises for a singular person.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12">This project can help normal people (and athletes and their lifting coaches/trainers if they have one) determine what their possible 1RM can be. Using the prediction model I come up with, people can use their own personal data of recorded lifts to judge how much weight they should be loading onto the bar when attempting a 1RM.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=13 data-line-end=14 ><a id="Research_Question_13"></a>Research Question</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">Can weightlifting 1RM performance be accurately predicted from submaximal training data?</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=16 data-line-end=17 ><a id="Target_Variables_16"></a>Target Variables</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18">Since there are multiple different lifts recorded in this dataset, i will either end up filtering it down to predict 1RM for either squats or bench press (or both!).</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="20">Predictor variables will include session maximums, number of repetitions, number of sets, and total training volume. I may engineer features, but am unsure as of now.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=21 data-line-end=22 ><a id="Limitations_and_Expected_Outcome_21"></a>Limitations and Expected Outcome</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="22" data-line-end="23">There are limitations here because of factors that are difficult to account for such as fatigue or what food peoiple are eating among other things</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="24" data-line-end="25">The expected outcome is to predict 1RM with reasonable error margins, providing insights for training and managing heavier weights.</p>
