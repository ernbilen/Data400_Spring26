#Research Question
To what extent are industrial air emissions and asthma-related emergency visits concentrated in Kentucky, and do socioeconomic factors play a role? 

---
### Main Analysis:
- Examines whether environmental exposure (industrial air emissions) and respiratory health outcomes (asthma) are geographically concentrated in the same Kentucky counties.
- And whether socioeconomic help factors explain some of the differences between counties high emission levels. 

**Datasets used (2018–2022)**:
1. Toxic Release Inventory (TRI): County-level total air emissions, facility counts, hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). 
2. Asthma: County-level emergency department visits for asthma.
3. CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI): County-level socioeconomic and demographic vulnerability indicators including poverty, housing burden, education, disability, minority status, and overall Ranking Percentile index.

### Number of TRI Facilities 
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("charts/Facilities-by-County.png")
```
- Establishes where industrial activity is concentrated.
- Counties with more facilities represent greater potential sources of airborne emissions.

### Top Emitting facilities

]

.pull-right[
<img src="charts/top-emitting-facilities.png" width="100%">
]

- First graph: matches with Jefferson emitting the most. 
- Second graph: Shows that a small number of facilities account for disproportionately large emissions such as in Ohio County which has 8 facilities compared to Jefferson's 71 but at the same time has the biggest facility in KY, emitting 7 million pounds.

### Air Pollutants
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="40%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("charts/Air-Pollutants.png")
```
<div style="font-size: 85%;">
Demonstrates that emissions are dominated by chemicals such as sulfuric acid, ammonia, and hydrochloric acid, which contribute to airway inflammation and PM2.5 formation. 

- Sulfuric acid (acid aerosols including mists): Strong respiratory irritant; Causes airway inflammation; Linked to asthma attacks; Fine acid particles can penetrate lungs
- Ammonia: Irritates airways, Reacts in atmosphere to form secondary particulate matter (PM2.5), PM2.5 is strongly associated with asthma
- Hydrochloric acid (acid aerosols including mists), Strong respiratory irritant, can trigger bronchospasm

### Asthma Burden – Jefferson County Case Study

- Left graph shows cumulative asthma emergency visit counts among KY counties from 2008–2022
- Right shows Jefferson County Asthma over the years from 2015-2022.

### Jefferson County: Chemical Trends
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="65%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("charts/trend-jeff-pollutant.png")
```
<div style="font-size: 83%;">
- From years 2008–2022, asthma emergency visits in Jefferson show a declining trend as seen before.  
- Emissions of ammonia, sulfuric acid, and hydrochloric acid decline or stabilize from 2018 to 2022.  
- These chemicals are either respiratory irritants themselves or precursors to PM2.5, which is strongly linked to asthma exacerbations.  
- As emissions diminish, so too does the potential for airborne irritants to trigger asthma responses among residents.  
- While asthma outcomes are influenced by additional factors (healthcare access, housing conditions, smoking prevalence), the consistent drop in these pollutants provides a plausible environmental explanation for improving asthma trends over time.

### Merged Analysis: Emissions, Asthma, and Social Vulnerability

.pull-left[
![](charts/SVI.png)
]

.pull-right[

- **Jefferson County**: Highest industrial air emissions and most TRI facilities in KY, with consistently high asthma reports.  
- **SVI (~0.6)**: Moderate vulnerability — high emissions without extreme socioeconomic disadvantage.  
- **Other high-emission counties**: Often higher SVI but lower asthma, suggesting environmental exposure may overlap more with social vulnerability elsewhere.

### To wrap up,
- Industrial air emissions in Kentucky are geographically concentrated, with counties such as Jefferson appearing among the highest emitters and highest asthma-related emergency visit rates

- However, this  is not consistent statewide: several counties emitting above the median level of industrial air pollutants also fall into the High Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) categories, yet do not exhibit similarly elevated asthma-related emergency visits.

- Within high-emission counties, those with High SVI scores are distinguished by greater socioeconomic vulnerability

- One possible explanation for this pattern is differential access to healthcare and diagnostic services: counties with high emissions and high vulnerability may face barriers to asthma detection or treatment, while lower-vulnerability counties such as Jefferson may report higher asthma incidence due to greater access to medical care and reporting infrastructure.
