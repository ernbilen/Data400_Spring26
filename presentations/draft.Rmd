# Introduction

- Project motivation  
- Research question  
- Why it matters  

---

# Polymarket
- An online prediction market for real-world event outcomes
- Users trade contracts whose prices reflect implied probabilities
- Typically framed as binary outcome questions (e.g., Yes/No)
- **Buy or Sell ”Yes” or “No” shares:** The price of a share reflects the market’s implied probability (e.g., $0.70 = 70%). You can trade in/out before the deadline.
- Markets settle based on real-world outcomes
- Regulated by Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)
