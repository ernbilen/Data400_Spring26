<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">My idea is to measure the effect of class size on math student achievement for middle schoolers in New York City Public Schools. NYCPS began a class size reduction program in September 2023 that placed a cap on class sizes. Since then class sizes have became smaller.</p>

<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">I need the class sizes by school for 2023 and 2025 by school: <a href="https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/government-reports/class-size-reports">https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/government-reports/class-size-reports</a></li>

<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="23">The New York department of education should care because if there is data that states that student teacher ratio and achievement are connected, we would know how to solve the decrease in achievement for math in this country. It also informs teachers and community members for who they should vote for based on what the students need to do better in math.</li>

<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="24" data-line-end="26">If we can find causation on student teacher ratio and achievement then we may help all students become higher performing in their math class. This can lead to better outcomes after high school perhaps a higher paying job or a stronger path to college if they want that. Additionally, it can save people money because many people with low quantitative reasoning skills make decisions based on emotions.</li>
