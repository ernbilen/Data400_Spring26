<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="10">TRACTABLE DATA:<br>
Correlation between New York City schools’ student attendance rate AND their students who are proficient in math.<br>
The data will be found on the NYCPS data which is publicly available.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="13">DATA RETRIEVAL<br>
I will make an excel file by combining the ones on the NYCPS data to have one with the school name, attendance rate, and student math scores.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="16">SPECIFICATION OF MODEL<br>
I will use linear regression to find correlations.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="19">IMPLICATIONS FOR STAKEHOLDERS<br>
This would inform schools if they should be more strict on attendance policies to make their students better at math. Additionally, having better math achievement could make the school receive more funds, so it is attractive for schools to know.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="23">ETHICAL LEGAL AND SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS<br>
We should care to know why students are not doing well in math. This research could help find this, and it could pose a potential solution. If this data finds a correlation with students doing poorly in math, it could find potential next places to look. If solutions are found, then our students may become better at math. Teachers would know what to worry about, and students would become more informed for making decisions.</p>
