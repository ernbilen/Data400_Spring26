# Hoa Ly - DATA 400 Spring 2026 
## Idea 2
Sentimental analysis of comments on Reddit
## Research question
**How can we predict a person's mental health based on what they say on the internet ?** 
## Data 
For this idea, I will be scraping data from Reddit.
## Model
I plan to use Twitter-roberta-based-sentiment model for the project. 
## Implications for stakeholders
- **Mental health professionals**
    - Could help identify early warning signs of depression, anxiety, or distress.
    - Could help researchers understand large-scale mental health trends.
    - However, online language is not always honest and representative. 
- **Internet user**
    - Early detection tools could encourage people to seek help.
    - Awareness of mental health language patterns may reduce stigma.

## Ethical, Legal, Societal Implications
- I dont think there is anything unethical about the data for this project, since people should be expecting what they posted online be viewed or even stored by other people. As well as the legal aspect of the project, there is nothing illegal either.
