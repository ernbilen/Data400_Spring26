# The Problem of Narrative Time:

.large[
Tristram Shandy attempts to tell his life story but **never arrives at the present**
]

--

.highlight-box[
By Volume 4, Tristram has covered only **one day** of his life

Yet the novel spans **9 volumes** and **~300 chapters**
]

--

.medium[
**The central question:**  
How does Sterne's temporal disorder function as narrative structure?
]

???
Speaker notes:
- Published 1759-1767, revolutionary experimental novel
- Narrator constantly digresses backward and forward in time
- Not random chaos—there's a pattern we can computationally model
- This talk shows how data visualization makes temporal structure visible

---

# Why Linear Chronology Fails

.pull-left-narrow[
### Traditional Biography
- Birth → Childhood → Youth → Death
- Chronological progression
- Linear narrative arc
]

.pull-right-wide[
### Tristram Shandy
- Begins with conception... 
- ...then jumps to Uncle Toby's war injury **decades earlier**
- ...then to Yorick's death **years before birth**
- ...then to present-day writing
- ...then back to childhood accidents
- **No sustained chronological sequence**
]

--

.key-point[
**Sterne's structure is not broken—it's deliberate**  
Digression becomes the primary narrative mode
]

???
Speaker notes:
- Traditional autobiography: Franklin, Rousseau follow chronological order
- Sterne deliberately frustrates this expectation
- The digressions ARE the point—not obstacles to the "real" story
- Question: Can we map this disorder systematically?

---

# Data Collection & Web Scraping Pipeline

.methodology[
**Source:** Project Gutenberg full text (HTML)  
**Method:** Python web scraping with BeautifulSoup
]

--

### Pipeline Architecture

1. **Chapter Extraction**
   - Regex pattern matching: `C H A P. [Roman numeral]`
   - 300+ chapters across 9 volumes
   - Full text preservation

--

2. **Intelligent Quotation Selection**
   - Temporal markers & character names
   - Keyword matching to narrative period

---
# Narrative Classification System

3\. **Narrative Classification**
   - 18 time period categories
   - Chronological position (-4 to 11)

???
Speaker notes:
- Not manual coding—fully automated and reproducible
- Quotation algorithm selects contextually relevant excerpts
- Each chapter gets chronological position based on story time
- Output: structured JSON with 300 annotated chapters

---

# Modeling Time: The -4 to 11 Scale

.timeline-grid[
.timeline-item.pre-birth[
**-4 to -1**  
Before Birth  
Family history, Namur, Yorick
]

.timeline-item.digressions[
**0**  
Digressions  
Timeless embedded narratives
]

.timeline-item.life[
**1 to 8**  
Tristram's Life  
Conception → Youth
]

.timeline-item.present[
**10-11**  
Present  
Tristram writing, meta-commentary
]
]

--

.highlight-box[
**Key Innovation:** Negative numbers represent *years before birth*

Position -2 = Uncle Toby wounded at Namur (decades before Tristram exists)  
Position 0 = Digressions outside story time  
Position 10 = Present-day narration
]

--

.medium[
**This allows us to plot:** Reading Order (1–300) vs. Chronological Position (-4 to 11)
]

???
Speaker notes:
- Not arbitrary—based on actual temporal relationships in text
- Negative scale shows how far back Sterne reaches
- Zero marks timeless philosophical asides
- Positive numbers follow life chronology
- Creates two-dimensional temporal map

---

# Visualization Architecture

### Dual-Panel Design

.pull-left[
**Top Panel: Narrative Path**
- X-axis: Reading order (1→300)
- Y-axis: Chronological position
- Connected line = reader's path through time
- Color-coded by narrative period
]

.pull-right[
**Bottom Panel: Distribution**
- Shows density at each position
- Reveals where novel "dwells"
- Stacked bars by period
]

--

.key-point[
**If the novel were linear:** smooth diagonal line  
**What we actually see:** wild temporal oscillation
]

???
Speaker notes:
- Two complementary views of same data
- Top: shows temporal MOVEMENT (reader's journey)
- Bottom: shows temporal DENSITY (where Sterne lingers)
- Not decorative—reveals structure of delay
- Every vertical jump = temporal disruption

# Interactive Narrative Model

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("newplot.png")
```

.footnote[
Dual-panel temporal architecture visualization
]

???
Speaker notes:
- This is the actual working model
- Notice the jagged line—not smooth progression
- Hover over points to see quotations from chapters
- Bottom panel shows Sterne spends ~80 chapters at position 10 (present)
- But spreads life events thinly across positive positions
- Pattern visible: oscillation between past/present/digression

---

# Key Insights from the Model

### Quantified Temporal Disruption

--

1. **Oscillation Pattern**
   - Novel jumps constantly: past (-4) → present (10) → digression (0)
   - No sustained chronological progression
   - Average jump magnitude: **6 chronological positions**

--

2. **Narrative Density**
   - **~80 chapters** at position 10 (present narration)
   - Only **~40 chapters** cover positions 1-8 (entire life)
   - **Present overwhelms chronology** by 2:1 ratio

--

3. **Structured Delay**
   - Toby's story split across positions -2, -1, and 7
   - Birth delayed until reading order ~60
   - Childhood scattered non-consecutively

--

.highlight-box[
**Finding:** Digressions are not chaos—they form a **temporal architecture**
]

???
Speaker notes:
- These are empirical findings from the data
- Not impressionistic—computationally measured
- The 2:1 ratio quantifies the "problem" of Tristram Shandy
- More time spent commenting than narrating
- This is the architecture of delay made visible

---

# What This Reveals About Sterne

.large[
**Thesis:** Sterne's digressions are **structural**, not ornamental
]

--

### Three Interpretive Claims:

--

1. **Memory operates non-linearly**
   - Flashbacks interrupt forward progress
   - Past intrudes on present constantly
   - The visualization **models memory itself**

--

2. **Narration is impossible**
   - To tell one story requires telling ten others
   - Each explanation demands further backstory
   - The act of writing **delays the story indefinitely**

--

3. **Form enacts argument**
   - Structure performs the impossibility of autobiography

???
Speaker notes:
- Not just showing disorder—arguing disorder is meaningful
- Visualization proves form and content are inseparable
- Sterne demonstrates autobiography is always incomplete
- Each digression reveals narrative as construct
- Modern readers frustrated by this—18th century readers delighted

# Conclusion

.pull-left[
### What I Built
- Web scraping pipeline
- 300-chapter dataset
- Chronological coding
- Interactive visualization
- Hoverable quotations
]

.pull-right[
### What I Learned
- Temporal disorder is **systematic**
- Digressions form **architecture**
- Visualization makes **structure visible**
- Computational methods reveal **literary patterns**
]

--

.key-point.large[
**Core finding:**  
Tristram Shandy's "chaos" is actually a **quantifiable oscillation**  
The jagged line reveals the **structure of delay**
]

???
Speaker notes:
- Started with question: how does temporal disorder work?
- Answer: it's patterned, measurable, visualizable
- DH methods don't replace close reading—they enable new close reading
- We can now SEE the structure Sterne built
- This approach applies to any non-linear narrative
- Questions?
