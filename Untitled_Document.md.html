<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=1 data-line-end=2 ><a id="Research_Question_1"></a>Research Question</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">Can macroeconomic and climate indicators help predict food price inflation volatility in South Asian countries</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=4 data-line-end=5 ><a id="Motivation_4"></a>Motivation</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">Food prices play a central role in household welfare across South Asia where a large share of income is spent on basic food consumption. While average food inflation is important, sudden increases or fluctuations in food prices can be even more harmful especially for low-income households that have limited ability to smooth consumption. Periods of high food price volatility can increase food insecurity and economic stress, even when overall inflation remains moderate.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8">South Asian countries are  vulnerable to external shocks such as global price changes, climate variability, and macroeconomic instability. This project aims to examine whether commonly used macroeconomic indicators and climate variables can help predict changes in food price inflation volatility. Understanding these relationships can help identify early warning signals of economic stress and contribute to better policy planning.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=9 data-line-end=10 ><a id="Data_Sources_9"></a>Data Sources</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">This project will use publicly available country level panel data for South Asian countries including India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">Food price data will be obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) food price indices. Macroeconomic indicators such as overall inflation will be sourced from the World Bank. Climate variables, including rainfall anomalies and temperature deviations, will be obtained from publicly available climate datasets.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=14 data-line-end=15 ><a id="Methodology_14"></a>Methodology</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16">The project will begin with exploratory data analysis to examine trends in food price inflation and its volatility across countries and over time. This will include time-series plots, summary statistics, and comparisons across countries to identify periods of unusually high volatility.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18">To model food price inflation volatility, I will construct a volatility measure using changes in food price inflation over time. I will then use macroeconomic and climate variables as predictors.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="20">As a baseline, I will estimate a linear regression model with lagged predictors to examine whether past macroeconomic and climate conditions are associated with future food price volatility. To allow for potential non-linear relationships, I will also estimate a Random Forest regression model and compare its predictive performance to the linear model.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=21 data-line-end=22 ><a id="Implications_for_Stakeholders_21"></a>Implications for Stakeholders</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="22" data-line-end="23">The findings from this project may be useful for policymakers and central banks in South Asia who monitor inflation and food security risks. Early identification of rising food price volatility could support more timely policy responses such as targeted subsidies or social protection measures.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="24" data-line-end="25">International organizations and development agencies may also benefit from understanding how climate and macroeconomic factors interact to influence food price instability.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=26 data-line-end=27 ><a id="Ethical_Considerations_26"></a>Ethical Considerations</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="28">The topic raises important societal concerns related to inequality and food insecurity. Food price volatility disproportionately affects low-income households who spend a larger share of their income on food and have limited ability to adjust consumption.</p>
