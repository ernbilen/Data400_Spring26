> How do economic downturns affect investment decisions in the U.S. economy? 
 

### Tractable Data
- Public, aggregate economic data that captures overall investment behavior in the U.S. economy
- Investment and economic conditions are measured at a broad level, making the data easy to manage and interpret
- The scope of the data focuses on data that is publicly available and does not rely on private investments.

### Data Retrieval
- Investment measures and economic indicators are available through government and research institutions
- Private Fixed Investment- Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
- NBER Recession Indicator- National Bureau of Economic Research, FRED

### Correct Specification of the Model
- Analysis will compare investment behavior during periods of economic downturn to periods of economic stability
- Model designed to examine whether changes in economic conditions are associated with changes in investment decisions

### Implications for Stakeholders
- Can help explain how investment behavior responds to economic uncertainty
- Policymakers can use this information to better understand the timing and magnitude of investment slowdowns
- The results provide insight into why economic recoveries may take time following downturns

### Ethical, Legal, and Societal Implications
- Reduced investment during downturns can have long-term effects on employment and economic growth
- Prolonged investment slowdowns may widen existing economic inequalities
- The analysis highlights the broader social importance of policies that encourage stable investment during periods of uncertainty
