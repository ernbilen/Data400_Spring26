# Idea Proposal #2
### Amelia Kim
> Does the introduction of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) compensation change college football team performance by altering where talent goes and how teams compete?

### Tractable Data
- This project uses tractable, publicly available data that captures both financial incentives and performance outcomes in college football. NIL activity is measured using team-level indicators such as estimated NIL values, number of reported deals, and NIL rankings, which summarize the financial opportunities available to athletes at each program. 
- Team performance is measured using standard outcomes such as win–loss records, point differentials, and conference standings. These variables are reported consistently across seasons and can be aggregated at the team-season level, making the dataset manageable and appropriate for a college-level empirical analysis.

### Data Retrieval
- On3: tracks reported NIL deals, estimated NIL valuations per player, and team-level NIL strength rankings.
- Two periods: pre-NIL period (before 2021) and post-NIL period (2021 onward)
- Analysis will focus on Power Five programs, where NIL activity and reporting are most prevalent. SEC, Big10, ACC, Big12, Pac12 (ended in 2024)

### Correct Specification of the Model
- Team Performance = f(NIL Activity, Recruiting Class Quality, Other Controls)
- Regression will test whether teams with greater NIL activity perform better on the field, holding constant underlying talent levels.
- Before-and-after comparisons are used to evaluate whether team outcomes changed following the introduction of NIL rules in 2021. 

### Implications for Stakeholders
- Athletic departments can use the results to understand how NIL opportunities relate to on-field success and recruiting strategies
- Coaches may adjust recruiting and roster management based on the relationship between NIL activity and team performance
- Conference leaders and policymakers can evaluate whether NIL policies are affecting competitive balance across programs
- Recruits and current athletes may use this information when deciding which programs offer both financial opportunities and competitive success

### Ethical, Legal, and Societal Implications
- NIL may disproportionately benefit programs with greater financial resources and media exposure, potentially widening inequality across schools
- Increased emphasis on NIL earnings could shift priorities away from education and athlete development. Uneven access to NIL opportunities raises fairness concerns for athletes at lower-revenue programs
