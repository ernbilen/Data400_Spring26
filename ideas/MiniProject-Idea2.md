# Who performs better: NYC vs Boston? Comparing public transit efficiency and equity between two Northeastern cities. 
### _by Tu Tong_

## Data Sources

- For New York's transportation data: 
    https://www.mta.info/open-data 
    https://mobilitydatabase.org/ 
    https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/ 

 

- For Massachusetts's transportation data: 
    https://gis.data.mass.gov/ 
    https://www.mbta.com/developers 

## Relevant Variables
- Transit access: number of stops, service frequency, proximity to station 
- Demographics: population density, income, minority share, car ownership 

## Data Retrieval
I will download and use geopandas to process and analyze data.

## Model 
I will try using either _Linear Regression_ (for general interpretation) or _Geospatial Regression_ (for spatial data specifically) and see which one provide better results.

 

## Implications for stakeholders 

For this project, stakeholders are both governments and people who live in those areas. The results of this analysis help people understand how well current public transportation systems function and how different communities can benefit from them. Mapping both current transportation systems and demographic data helps highlight and identify areas of high demand and underserved areas in these two cities. The results from this will help with planning and improving those systems to serve people better. 



## Ethical, legal, societal implications 

- Identify underserved areas and high-demand locations.
- Inform strategies such as increasing service frequency, adding new routes, or adjusting fare systems.
- Cross-city learning: the better-performing system can serve as a model for improvement
