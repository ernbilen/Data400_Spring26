What characteristics and types of commutes influence the choice of rail over a car, if any?</h3>
<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=4 data-line-end=5 ><a id="Introduction_4"></a>Introduction</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">Owning and commuting via car is the main mode of transportation in the United States. Being a private type of transportation, it has a lot of benefits compared to other modes such as comfort, solitude, and ownership. But such benefits come at a higher cost paid for the vehicle, as well as its maintenance. For my project, I want to compare the car commute to the rail commute, and analyze which of the two options becomes a more financially feasible one.</p>
<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=7 data-line-end=8 ><a id="Tractable_Data__Data_Retrieval_7"></a>Tractable Data &amp; Data Retrieval</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">In terms of the data for this project, I will be using NHTS’ National OD dataset to get a sense of travel behaviors of the commuters in the US. This data can be expanded to both national and local levels, and includes OD (origin-destination) which would help me determine the costs of travel in my research. This data is openly available to be downloaded since it is conducted by the Federal Highway Administration, which is a governmental body. I will look at trip duration, trip types (work, non-work, vacation, etc.), and time of trip.</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="11"><a href="https://nhts.ornl.gov/od/">NHTS National OD Data</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="13">While this data can tell me more about the commuters’ behavior patterns and get data regarding travel, it does not contain any data regarding the costs of travel. Therefore, I will need to access rail fare information online. I plan to do that by manually searching for several trip types depending on the O-D, day &amp; time differences, and passenger class. I will be using Amtrak data for the costs of rail transportation, since it is a government-owned corporation.<br>
Depending on the scale, it might involve web-scraping, or simply manually recording the information into the table.</p>
<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=14 data-line-end=15 ><a id="Model_Specification_14"></a>Model Specification</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16">I plan to create two generalized models for the cost of commute for the rail and car. I am considering including the variables such as the rail fare, cost of fuel, approximate value of time (which I will change in order to understand the effects), parking cost, and time it costs to get to the destination via car versus rail. I plan to apply logistic regression to both cost models and random forest regression in order to understand the variable importance and the significance of the effect the predictors have on the response variable, which is cost of travel. I will then compare the two costs, and investigate the characteristics and details of the scenarios where the cost of rail is less than car. Such details might include region, duration, distance, income/passenger type, car ownership, fuel costs, or others. This will ultimately help me answer my research question and make justified recommendations.</p>
<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=17 data-line-end=18 ><a id="Implications_for_stakeholders_17"></a>Implications for stakeholders</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="18" data-line-end="19">There are vast stakeholder implications that can be associated with this project. Firstly, the government is one actor that can benefit from this research, as they are the main provider of the travel behavior data. I am sure this research could help the government understand which mode is more efficient in terms of maximizing savings for citizens, and then think about policies that would help improve that infrastructure. Today the government spends a lot on building highways as it is the default method of transportation. But if rail deems to be a financially smarter choice, it might want to concentrate some investment towards improving Amtrak travel.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="20" data-line-end="21">Another big stakeholder is the citizens who are commuting via car or train themselves, which happens to be a lot of people, with an emphasis put on the group of citizens that are considering buying a car, and are choosing between rail and car travel. They would be interested in learning whether their decisions of owning/commuting via their car would be beneficial, or whether it would make more sense to use public transportation via rail. Additionally, another group of people that could benefit from this research are the people who are planning singular, not recurring, trips. For this purpose, they might be considering renting a car versus buying a one- or two-way ticket to their destination. My research could provide them with quantitative information to make a decision based on their financial and comfort preferences.</p>
<h5 class="code-line" data-line-start=23 data-line-end=24 ><a id="Ethical_legal_societal_implications_23"></a>Ethical, legal, societal implications</h5>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="24" data-line-end="25">The societal implications are very similar to the ideas reflected in the section above, regarding the financial impact this research findings may have on the individuals deciding between the two modes to achieve their travel goals. This project could contain environmental implications. If rail is deemed to be a better choice financially, and if more people decide to use the public transportation moving forward, the mere usage of fewer cars will lead to less CO2 emissions, which reduces the environmental damage we produce as a society, compared to a small fixed number of emissions that trains produce, if any. These environmental benefits could have ethical implications, as some people view it as our ethical and moral duty to protect the planet and the environment by doing everything we can to reduce the environmental damage.</p>
