<blockquote>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">Does the introduction of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) compensation change college football team performance by altering where talent goes and how teams compete?</p>

<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">This project uses tractable, publicly available data that captures both financial incentives and performance outcomes in college football. NIL activity is measured using team-level indicators such as estimated NIL values, number of reported deals, and NIL rankings, which summarize the financial opportunities available to athletes at each program.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="8">Team performance is measured using standard outcomes such as win–loss records, point differentials, and conference standings. These variables are reported consistently across seasons and can be aggregated at the team-season level, making the dataset manageable and appropriate for a college-level empirical analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=8 data-line-end=9 ><a id="Data_Retrieval_8"></a>Data Retrieval</h3>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">On3: tracks reported NIL deals, estimated NIL valuations per player, and team-level NIL strength rankings.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">Two periods: pre-NIL period (before 2021) and post-NIL period (2021 onward)</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="13">Analysis will focus on Power Five programs, where NIL activity and reporting are most prevalent. SEC, Big10, ACC, Big12, Pac12 (ended in 2024)</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=13 data-line-end=14 ><a id="Correct_Specification_of_the_Model_13"></a>Correct Specification of the Model</h3>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">Team Performance = f(NIL Activity, Recruiting Class Quality, Other Controls)</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16">Regression will test whether teams with greater NIL activity perform better on the field, holding constant underlying talent levels.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="18">Before-and-after comparisons are used to evaluate whether team outcomes changed following the introduction of NIL rules in 2021.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=18 data-line-end=19 ><a id="Implications_for_Stakeholders_18"></a>Implications for Stakeholders</h3>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="20">Athletic departments can use the results to understand how NIL opportunities relate to on-field success and recruiting strategies</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="20" data-line-end="21">Coaches may adjust recruiting and roster management based on the relationship between NIL activity and team performance</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="22">Conference leaders and policymakers can evaluate whether NIL policies are affecting competitive balance across programs</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="22" data-line-end="24">Recruits and current athletes may use this information when deciding which programs offer both financial opportunities and competitive success</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=24 data-line-end=25 ><a id="Ethical_Legal_and_Societal_Implications_24"></a>Ethical, Legal, and Societal Implications</h3>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26">NIL may disproportionately benefit programs with greater financial resources and media exposure, potentially widening inequality across schools</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="26" data-line-end="27">Increased emphasis on NIL earnings could shift priorities away from education and athlete development. Uneven access to NIL opportunities raises fairness concerns for athletes at lower-revenue programs</li>
</ul>
